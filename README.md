# The-Gaming-Room
# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client name The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game and currently the game called Draw It or Lose It available only in Android app version. Based on client’s information, the problem is the app is only works in Android devices but the if the web-based version and all operating platform version lunched then the problem of only Android version would be addressed, and the certain users would be multiple users around the world.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I evaluate the different platform’s advantages and weakness as well as mobile device consider the requirements outlined below and articulate your findings for each. And analyzed the characteristics of and techniques specific to various systems architectures and make a recommendation to The Gaming Room.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Through a design document, I found helpful information when developing the code of the game because it has complete direction of the class and method that should be done and the represented the app components as well.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Probably I would go deeper to the evaluation section to come up with more precisely about what is the most requirements in terms of developing tools, client side, service side requirements.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Based on user needs, the information that that provided by the user needs to be implemented into the design. The user needs were not complicated to interpret because all user’s needs were to expand the game compatible to almost all kinds of platform.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The requirement of the user is the most important to understand before designing the software and the techniques or strategies that I would use in future is to create the model and evaluate the advantages and weakness and go through the recommendation.
